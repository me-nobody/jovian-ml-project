    " ### <font style=\"font-size:18px;font-family:arial;color:green;text-indent:100px;line-height: 0.8;word-spacing: 10px\"> A cancerous tissue can have thousands of genetic mutations (Variations), which are discovered using genome sequencing. But the challenge is distinguishing the mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations (passengers). Currently this interpretation of genetic mutations is being done manually. This is a very time-consuming task where a clinical pathologist has to manually review and classify every single genetic mutation based on evidence from text-based clinical literature. For this competition MSKCC is making available an expert-annotated knowledge base where world-class researchers and oncologists have manually annotated thousands of mutations. MSKCC intends the Data scientist to develop a Machine Learning algorithm that, using this knowledge base as a baseline, automatically classifies genetic variations.</font>"

    "### <font style=\"font-size:18px;font-family:arial;color:green;text-indent:100px;line-height: 0.8;word-spacing: 10px\"><i>Gene</i> is a stretch of DNA encoding a specific functional molecule, a protein. Variation is <i>Mutation</i>,  which occurs in the gene and changes the function of the protein. Proteins are made up of 20 amino acids and these are designated by the following alphabets; A,R,N,D,C,Q,E,G,H,I,L,K,M,F,P,S,T,W,Y and V. In the variation column, the first alphabet is the orginal amino acid, the number is the physical position in the gene where the change has occured and the last alphabet is the changed amino acid. The Text dataset contains the information for the Gene, the Variation and the Class column in the variants dataset. The 2 datasets are linked by the common ID column</font>"

    "### <font style=\"font-size:18px;font-family:arial;color:blue;text-indent:100px;line-height: 0.8;word-spacing: 10px\"> Mutation acquisition is a rare event. The Poisson distribution is used to describe the distribution of rare events in a large population. For example, at any particular time, there is a certain probability that a particular cell within a large population of cells will acquire a mutation.                                                                                   -Frank H. Stephenson, in Calculations for Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (Second Edition), 2010. The distribution of mutations per gene in this dataset follows the usual pattern of Poisson distribution seen in general for mutations. 3321 mutations, or variations, are distributed in 195 genes. 14 genes have more than 20 mutations, which are often classified in different classes. It would be worthwhile to investigate, why certain mutations are classified in certain specific classes </font>"
