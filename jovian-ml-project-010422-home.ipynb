    " ### <font style=\"font-size:18px;font-family:arial;color:green;text-indent:100px;line-height: 0.8;word-spacing: 10px\"> A cancerous tissue can have thousands of genetic mutations (Variations), which are discovered using genome sequencing. But the challenge is distinguishing the mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations (passengers). Currently this interpretation of genetic mutations is being done manually. This is a very time-consuming task where a clinical pathologist has to manually review and classify every single genetic mutation based on evidence from text-based clinical literature. For this competition MSKCC is making available an expert-annotated knowledge base where world-class researchers and oncologists have manually annotated thousands of mutations. MSKCC intends the Data scientist to develop a Machine Learning algorithm that, using this knowledge base as a baseline, automatically classifies genetic variations.</font>"

Variation is <i>Mutation</i>,  which occurs in the gene and changes the function of the protein. Proteins are made up of 20 amino acids and these are designated by the following alphabets; A,R,N,D,C,Q,E,G,H,I,L,K,M,F,P,S,T,W,Y and V. In the variation column, the first alphabet is the orginal amino acid, the number is the physical position in the gene where the change has occured and the last alphabet is the changed amino acid. The Text dataset contains the information for the Gene, the Variation and the Class column in the variants dataset. The 2 datasets are linked by the common ID column</font>"

    "### <font style=\"font-size:18px;font-family:arial;color:blue;text-indent:100px;line-height: 0.8;word-spacing: 10px\"> Mutation acquisition is a rare event. The Poisson distribution is used to describe the distribution of rare events in a large population. For example, at any particular time, there is a certain probability that a particular cell within a large population of cells will acquire a mutation.                                                                                   -Frank H. Stephenson, in Calculations for Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (Second Edition), 2010. The distribution of mutations per gene in this dataset follows the usual pattern of Poisson distribution seen in general for mutations. 3321 mutations, or variations, are distributed in 195 genes. 14 genes have more than 20 mutations, which are often classified in different classes. It would be worthwhile to investigate, why certain mutations are classified in certain specific classes </font>"

    "#### The p53 protein is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. When the DNA in a cell becomes damaged by agents such as toxic chemicals, radiation, or ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight, this protein plays a critical role in determining whether the DNA will be repaired or the damaged cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). If the DNA can be repaired, p53 activates other genes to fix the damage. If the DNA cannot be repaired, this protein prevents the cell from dividing and signals it to undergo death. By stopping cells with mutated or damaged DNA from dividing, p53 helps prevent the development of tumors"

The median mutations per gene is 4, with most genes having but 1 mutation. These classes have a functional significance, which can be understood by reading the text. There is no direct correlation to the usual classification based on pathways or on location. This could be due to the fact that these mutations have been classified on clinical signifcance, and each protein has an unique structural organization. Thus we shall now use the tools of NLP to model the classification </font>"
